## Team If

Team If is a dedicated group of fans of various expertise who works on translating and localizing Japanese games for English speaking audiences. Our vision is to translate the games as faithfully as possible. The team is split into three divisions. The divisions work closely together and are currently working on Fire Emblem Fates/If and Great Ace Attorney (Dai Gyakuten Saiban). 

### Division I

Division I members were the original translators, coders, and editors who worked on the fan translation of the main story of Fire Emblem Fates. Division I is not officially active, but many members are lending a hand to the other divisions.

### Division II

Division II is the group currently working on finishing the fan translation of Fire Emblem Fates. 

### Division III

Division III is more publicly known as the Dai Gyakuten Saiban fan translation team. They are up and coming hard working members of the various communities from around the world. Dai Gyakuten Saiban is an entry to the Ace Attorney series by Capcom that never made it out of the US, and seemingly has no plans to either. Therefore, the team feels that it is their duty as die hard fans to bring this game to life in English.
