# Team If

<img src='../team_if_logo_final.png' alt='Team If Logo' style='float: right; margin: 0% 0% 5% 5% ; height: 150px;'>

Team If is a dedicated group of fans who works on translating and localizing Japanese games for English speaking audiences. Our vision is to translate the games as faithfully as possible. The team is split into two divisions. The divisions work closely together and are currently working on Fire Emblem: Fates/If and Great Ace Attorney (Dai Gyakuten Saiban).

### Fire Emblem Division

> The Fire Emblem division is the group currently working on finishing the fan translation of Fire Emblem: Fates. They are currently hard at work translating and editing the remainder of the game, as well as incorporating the feedback received from the community regarding the current patch. Most of the division is comprised of newer members, but a handful of the old translation team remain to lend a hand.

### Dai Gyakuten Saiban Division

> The DGS division is more publicly known as the Dai Gyakuten Saiban fan translation team. They are up and coming hard working members of the various communities from around the world. Dai Gyakuten Saiban is an entry to the Ace Attorney series by Capcom that never made it out of Japan, and seemingly has no plans to either. Therefore, the team feels that it is their duty as die hard fans to bring this game to life in English.
